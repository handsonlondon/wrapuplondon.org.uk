      <h3>Is Wrap Up London a charity?</h3>
      <p>
        Wrap Up London is a campaign run by the registered charity Hands On
        London (1140291). Founded in 2010, Hands On London offers opportunities
        for individuals to volunteer with third sector organisations across
        Greater London and organises corporate group employee volunteering
        events, strengthening corporate social responsibility initiatives. With
        a huge variety of projects to get involved in, Hands On London is
        inspiring Londoners to make a difference in their communities. If you’d
        like to know more about Hands On London, why not check out our
        <a href="https://handsonlondon.org.uk">website</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Where do the coats go?</h3>
      <p>
        Coats donated to Wrap Up London go directly to people across London who
        struggle to keep warm during the winter months. Coats are distributed
        via homeless shelters, refugee centres, organisations supporting the
        elderly, women’s refuges, children’s centres and other charities helping
        people in crisis. The number of coats our beneficiaries receive is based
        on the number they request and the amount the campaign manages to
        collect.
      </p>

      <h3>I have a light jacket - will that do?</h3>
      <p>
        We accept coats and jackets of all weights, however it is preferable to
        our charity partners to receive heavy duty coats that are weather
        resistant. Your light coat may act as layering, so please do consider
        donating it.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Will you take duvets, sleeping bags or other clothes apart from coats?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Please don’t send us any other clothing or items.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We can only accept coats.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hands On London charity is a small organisation and, together with the
        <a href="/wrap-up-family">other Wrap Up campaigns</a>, is powered almost
        exclusively by volunteers. We do not have the operational capacity or
        connections to store, distribute or dispose of anything other than the
        coats our partners have requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2018, we spent so much time and money redirecting unrequested items
        that our coat deliveries were delayed by almost two weeks!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have other clothes or items that you would like to donate to a
        good cause, why not check out
        <a href="https://droppoint.org">droppoint.org</a>, a network of
        charitable organisations asking for items they can use, who would love
        to help!
      </p>

      <h3>
        Can you guarantee my donation really does go to someone who needs it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We liaise directly with our charity partners and beneficiaries, who have
        been chosen based on proximity to London and predetermined need. We work
        with many of these charities throughout the year, so can confidently
        confirm that they serve London’s most vulnerable people. Should we have
        a surplus of coats will look at organisations outside of the city to
        ensure your donation reaches a vulnerable person.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you tell me where my donation goes?</h3>
      <p>
        Your donation will go to one of over 100 London based charities and
        community organisations. The Hands On London team can provide more
        details on this. Please drop us a line at
        <a href="mailto:info@handsonlondon.org.uk">info@handsonlondon.org.uk</a>
        if you’d like to find out more.
      </p>

      <h3>Your campaign looks like you've spent a lot of money on it…</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://handsonlondon.org.uk">Hands On London</a> - the charity
        that organises Wrap Up London - has only 3.5 full time paid members of
        staff. The campaign is primarily supported by a small team of dedicated
        volunteers. We are lucky that so many wonderful organisations and
        individuals believe in the campaign and want to make it a success; it is
        their generosity that enables Wrap Up London to happen. Every year, over
        800 volunteers give up their own personal time to help vulnerable
        Londoners by making Wrap Up London happen. 150 companies make a
        contribution in kind.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I help?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes! Sign up to help us collect and sort through donated coats at:
        <a href="mailto:wulvolunteers@handsonlondon.org.uk"
          >wulvolunteers@handsonlondon.org.uk</a
        >
      </p>

      <h3>
        I can’t help at the tube stations. Is there some other way I can give my
        time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes! As the campaign develops we need help with all sorts of things,
        from delivering small coat donations, assistance on the days charities
        pick up their coats and a number of one off tasks that develop. We are
        always grateful for people who pick up our social media messages and
        share them. Even if you are just passing by, take a selfie and post it!
      </p>

      <h3>Why do you have big businesses on your leaflets?</h3>
      <p>
        We are grateful to all our sponsors, who choose to sponsor different
        parts of Wrap Up London. Without their backing, Wrap Up London would not
        be sustainable.
      </p>

      <h3>
        There are homeless people outside tube station - why don't you just take
        the coats directly outside?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We have worked very closely with homeless charities for several years.
        Their advice is to distribute the coats we collect through them rather
        than directly. This is to ensure that the coats reach those most in
        need. People who receive the coats are encouraged to collect them from
        shelters, centres etc. Whilst there, they are able to access other
        services that can help them rebuild their lives.
