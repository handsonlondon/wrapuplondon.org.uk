    <h2>How your coat helps</h2>
    <p>
      Once we’ve collected coats from the public, the volunteers get to work at our sorting sessions. We spend many hours sorting coats into different piles for men, women, children and babies. We check pockets, mend buttons, and make sure the coat is in good
      enough condition to be given away. If you’d like to lend a helping hand at a sorting session, click here.

    <p>
      In December, the sorted coats will be distributed to charities across London. We carefully select charities that provide frontline services to the homeless, the elderly, refugees, children and families living in poverty and people fleeing domestic violence.
      These coats are intended for people, not charity shops. If you can help us transport the coats from Safestore to charity, get in touch today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrap Up London don’t distribute the coats to those in need directly, because we want to help charities create lasting exchanges with those they set out to help. SO when a vulnerable Londoner reaches out to a charity for a coat this winter, they will also
      discover the other resources and forms of support available to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s amazing that a coat YOU donated could kick-start a relationship between those in need and the charities that can help them by providing year-round services and support. Wrap Up London is now in its seventh year, and our impact continues to grow thanks
      to the Londoners who take the time to find and donate their old coats, and the incredible volunteers that help run the entire campaign. The campaign is ran by Hands On London, a charity ran by volunteers – for volunteers. Click here to read
