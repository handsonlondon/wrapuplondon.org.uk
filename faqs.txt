<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>Where do coats go?</h3>
<p>Coats donated to Wrap Up London go directly to people across London who traditionally struggle to keep warm during the winter months. Coats are distributed via homeless shelters, refugee centres, elderly organisations, women’s refuges, children’s centres and other charities. The number of coats beneficiaries is based on the number they request, as well as predetermined need.</p>
<h3>I have only a light jacket - will that do?</h3>
<p>We accept coats and jackets of all weights, however it is preferable to our charity partners to receive heavy duty coats that are weather resistant. Your light coat may act as layering, so please do consider donating it.  </p>
<h3>Will you take duvets, jumpers sleeping bags etc?</h3>
<p>Wrap Up London accepts donations of coats that are distributed based on predetermined need. We would recommend seeking other charity drives if you wish to donate alternative items.  </p>
<h3>Can you guarantee my donation really does go to someone who needs it?</h3>
<p>We liaise directly with our charity partners and beneficiaries, who have been chosen based on proximity to London and predetermined need. We work with many of these charities throughout the year, so can confidently confirm that they serve London’s most vulnerable people. </p>
<h3>Will my coat be sold on?</h3>
<p>We will only distribute coats to organisations that work with vulnerable people in London. For the small percentage of coats that are donated in very poor condition, we work with a London based recycling organisation. This organisation offers ethical use of the recycled product and is supportive of people getting back into employment.</p>
<h3>Can you tell me where my donation goes?</h3>
<p>Your donation will go to one of 200 London based charities. The Hands On London Office can provide more details on this.</p>
<h3>Your campaign looks like you've spent a lot of money on it...can you confirm?</h3>
<p>Hands on London - the charity that brings Wrap Up London has only three paid members of staff. We are lucky that so many wonderful organisations and individuals believe in the campaign and want to make it a success, it is their generosity that enables Wrap Up London to happen. To that extent, over 1000 volunteers give up their own, personal time to help vulnerable Londoners by running the Wrap Up London campaign.</p>
<h3>Can I help?</h3>
<p>Yes! Sign up to help us collect and sort through donated coats at: wulvolunteers@handsonlondon.org.uk</p>
<h3>Why do you have banks and big businesses on your leaflets?</h3>
<p>We are grateful to all of our sponsors, who choose to sponsor different parts of Wrap Up London. Without their backing, Wrap Up London would not be sustainable.</p>
<h3>Why is my tube fare going up whilst you're asking me to give up my possessions?</h3>
<p>Wrap Up London is a campaign brought to you by Hands on London - a charity offering opportunities for individuals to volunteer with third sector organisations across Greater London (1140291). Should you have queries outside of the campaign, please contact Transport For London directly.</p>
<h3>There are homeless people outside this station - why don't you just take the coats directly outside?</h3>
<p>We have worked very closely with homeless charities for several years. Their advice is to distribute through themselves rather than directly. This is to ensure that the coats reach those most in need. People are encouraged to collect from shelters, centres etc. Whilst there, they are able to access other services they may also need during the winter months.</p>
